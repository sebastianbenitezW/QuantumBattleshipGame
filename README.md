# QuantumBattleshipGame
In this project, quantum algorithms are used to simulate a two-player strategy-type guessing game performed on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of warships is marked. The locations of the fleets are hidden from the other players. It was done for the Hackathon Qiskit Fall Fest Peru 2022.
